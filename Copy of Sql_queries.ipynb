This project aims to develop a Local Food Wastage Management System, where:\n","Restaurants and individuals can list surplus food.\n","NGOs or individuals in need can claim the food.\n","SQL stores available food details and locations.\n","A Streamlit app enables interaction, filtering, CRUD operation and visualization.\n","\n","Business Use Cases\n","Connecting surplus food providers to those in need through a structured platform.\n","Reducing food waste by redistributing excess food efficiently.\n","Enhancing accessibility via geolocation features to locate food easily.\n","Data analysis on food wastage trends for better decision-making.\n","\n","Approach\n"," 1. Data Preparation\n","Utilize a provided dataset containing food donation records.\n","Ensure consistency and accuracy in data formatting.\n","2. Database Creation\n","Store food availability data in SQL tables.\n","Implement CRUD operations for updating, adding, and removing records.\n","3. Data Analysis.\n","Identify food wastage trends based on categories, locations, and expiry dates.\n","Generate reports for effective food distribution.\n","4. Application Development\n","Develop a Streamlit-based user interface to:\n","Display output of the  15 SQL queries .\n","Provide filtering options based on city, provider, food type, and meal type.\n","Show contact details of providers for direct coordination.\n","5. Deployment\n","Deploy the Streamlit application for accessibility and real-time interaction\n","\n","Data Flow and Architecture\n","1. Data Storage:\n","Use SQL database to store food donations, locations, and provider details.\n","2. Processing Pipeline:\n","Do analysis and generate insights into food wastage patterns.\n","3.
